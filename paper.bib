	abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {The Markov Random Walk model has been recently exploited for multi-document summarization by making use of the link relationships between sentences in the document set, under the assumption that all the sentences are indistinguishable from each other. However, a given document set usually covers a few topic themes with each theme represented by a cluster of sentences. The topic themes are usually not equally important and the sentences in an important theme cluster are deemed more salient than the sentences in a trivial theme cluster. This paper proposes the Cluster-based Conditional Markov Random Walk Model (ClusterCMRW) and the Cluster-based HITS Model (ClusterHITS) to fully leverage the cluster-level information. Experimental results on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets demonstrate the good effectiveness of our proposed summarization models. The results also demonstrate that the ClusterCMRW model is more robust than the ClusterHITS model, with respect to different cluster numbers.},
