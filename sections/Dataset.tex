\section{Dataset}
Nordjyske is a media group maintaining many local newspapers, radios and websites in the North Jutland region of Denmark.
The 'Nordjyske' dataset consists of news articles from 2017-2019. 
Each article is represented with a \texttt{pdf} file and an \texttt{xml} file, as well as one \texttt{png} file for each image in the article.
This data set, we are using, is only a subset of all articles at 'Nordjyske'.
We choose articles because of their recent creation and the article structure.

Currently we extract only the ID, body text, and headline from the xml files, though they do contain more information, such as authors, references to images, article type, date of publishing, etc.

The structure of a document in the data set is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ID
	\item Headline
	\item Body
\end{itemize}
