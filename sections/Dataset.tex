\section{Dataset}
Nordjyske is a media group maintaining many local newspapers, radios and websites in the North Jutland region of Denmark.
The 'Nordjyske' dataset consists of news articles from 2017-2019. 
Each article is represented with a \texttt{pdf} file and an \texttt{xml} file, as well as one \texttt{png} file for each image in the article.
This data set, we are using, is only a subset of all articles at 'Nordjyske'.
We choose articles because of their recent creation and the article structure.
We also wanted to include 2020, because of the Covid-19 could have been interesting, but 'Nordjyske' had an error within that time period, so they do not have access to those articles at the time.

Currently we extract only the ID, body text, and headline from the xml files, though they do contain more information, such as authors, references to images, article type, date of publishing, etc.
