\subsection{Distributions of the Corpus and Topics by Word Count}
In this section, we will investigate the word count distributions for the corpus and the topics shown in \autoref{fig:30TopicWords}, and describe some observations.

In \autoref{fig:corpus_wc_distribution}, the word count distribution of the whole corpus can be seen.
Here the word count can be seen of the x-axis, and the number of documents that have these word counts are on the y-axis.
This gives an overall idea of the size of the documents after preprocessing.
Just by looking at the distribution, it is clear that there are a lot of documents of smaller sizes.
There is a clear spike from word counts of around 20-100, and this drops steadily until around a word count of 1000, where only few documents appear afterwards.
Statistics of this distribution can also be seen on the right side of the figure.
The average document size is 256, and the median document size is 190.
It also confirms that the distribution is mainly in the range from 24-1182, which can be seen from the 1st and 99th percentile.
This is a good sign since part of our preprocessing was meant to remove the empty and very short documents, to still have enough context to find topics.

In \autoref{fig:topic_wc_distribution}, word count distributions of the topics from \autoref{fig:30TopicWords} can be seen, along with a smoothed distribution curve.
The axes are the same as in the corpus distribution.
The main observation is that some topics have much larger quantities of documents compared to others.
For example, topic 1 seemingly has many documents of a variety of sizes, while topic 2 is much smaller in size and includes mainly small-sized documents.
This might indicate a slight imbalance in the number of documents that are highly weighted to the topics, though this might not be a problem.
