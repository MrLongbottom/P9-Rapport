\subsection{Variational Inference}
When using topic models and other Bayesian models, it is computationally infeasable to compute the posterior, which means approximation is needed. 
Approaches today use two types of inference algorithms to estimate this; sampling and optimization approaches.
A widely used sampling approach is the MCMC algorithm Gibbs Sampling.
Gibbs sampling approximates the posterior distribution by trying to infer hidden structure by iteratively recalculate the state of each node based on its neighbors or similar nodes in a Bayesian network.
Variational inference is often used as a optimization approach where
