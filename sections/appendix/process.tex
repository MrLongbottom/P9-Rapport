\subsection{Project Process}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Initial Idea - Combine LDA and PageRank (clustering)
	\item Preprocessing \& LDA implementation
	\item Adjacency matrix construction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item challenges with calculation time
		\item focus on more restricting preprocessing and thresholds
	\end{itemize}
	\item Bad results
	\item Discovery of related papers
	\item Found out our model didn't converge
\end{itemize}
