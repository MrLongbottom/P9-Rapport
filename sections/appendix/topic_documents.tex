\subsection{Representative documents for topics}
In \autoref{tab:representative_documents} 5 documents that are representative of the 5 topics from \autoref{fig:30TopicWords} can be seen.
In this table the topic number, document number, the weight of the document, and the document itself are shown.
Here, the weight is the probability of the document having been generated by a specific topic in the \gls{lda} model.
The weights for a document are the same as the topic probability distribution $\theta$ for the document.
The document chosen to represent a given topic, is the document with the highest weight for the topic out of all documents.
