\section{Pipeline}

\input{figures/pipeline_figure.tex}
The pipeline of our framework is divided into five phases which are displayed in \autoref{fig:pipeline}.

\subsection{Article dataset}
We have an data set consisting of articles from the media group Nordjyske. Their primary focus is to maintain a variety of local newspapers within the North Jutland region of Denmark. 
The data ranges from 2017-2019, where a total of ~270.000 articles have been extracted from their database.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
The extracted articles use the format:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Id
	\item Headline
	\item Body
\end{itemize}
When training the LDA model, we concatenate the Headline and Body for simplicity.
The preprocessing phase is described further in detail in \todo[inline]{ref til preprocessing}.
This phase applies some processes to simplify the dataset and remove redundant information. 
After the preprocessing phase, we are left with ~130.000 articles.

\subsection{LDA}
We apply the \acrfull{LDA} to the dataset to generate topic clusters based on the content of the articles. 
We describe the investigation and selection of hyper parameters in \todo{ref til LDA section}. 
After the model has been trained, we have a document-topic distribution matrix $\theta$ and a topic-word distribution matrix $\varphi$.
$\theta$ will be used as clusters in the next phase.

\subsection{Clustering PageRank}
In this phase, we apply a clustering random walk\todo{cite clusteirng pagerank} to the articles and clusters given in the \gls{LDA} phase.
The algorithm yields a prioritized list of articles based on the query provided.


\subsection{Query Processing}
The query given to the search algorithm is stemmed and turned into a list of words. 
This list of words are then queried against LDA and to check which cluster each word belongs to.
Lastly it is transformed into a personalization vector to use within the Clustering PageRank.
