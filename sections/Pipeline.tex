\section{Pipeline}

\input{figures/pipeline_figure.tex}
The pipeline of our framework is divided into five different phases which are displayed in \autoref{fig:pipeline}.

\subsection{Article dataset}
We have an dataset consisting of articles from the media group Nordjyske, whose primary focus is maintaining a variety of local newspapers within the North Jutland region of Denmark. 
The data is from 2017-2019, where a total of ~270.000 articles have been extracted from their database.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
The articles are on the format:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Id
	\item Headline
	\item Body
\end{itemize}
When training the LDA model, we concatenate the Headline and Body for simplicity.
The preprocessing phase is described further in detail in \todo[inline]{ref til preprocessing}.
This phase applies some processes to simplify the dataset and remove redundant noise from the data. 
After the preprocessing phase, we are left with 130.000 articles.
