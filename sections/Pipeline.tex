\section{Pipeline}
This section describes our framework on an abstract level.
Each of these phases are described later on in more detail. 

\subsection{Article dataset}
We have a dataset consisting of articles from the media group Nordjyske. Their primary focus is to maintain a variety of local newspapers within the North Jutland region of Denmark. 
The data ranges from 2017-2019, where a total of $\sim$270.000 articles have been extracted from their database.

\subsection{Preprocessing Phase}
This phase applies different \gls{NLP} methods, such as stemming and removing stop words, to simplify the data set and remove redundant information.
After finishing this phase, we are left with $\sim$130.000 articles, which will be used in the phase.

\subsection{LDA}
We train an \acrfull{lda} on the data set to generate topic clusters based on the content of the articles. 
We describe the investigation and selection of hyper parameters in \autoref{subsec:lda}. 
After the model has been trained, we have a document-topic distribution matrix $\theta$ and a topic-word distribution matrix $\beta$.
$\theta$ will be used as clusters in the next phase.

\subsection{Cluster-based PageRank}
In this phase, we use cluster-based random walk, described in \autoref{sec:cluster_pagerank}, to rank the articles based clusters given in the \gls{lda} phase.
Before we are able to rank the articles, we need to process a search query first to figure out which articles to focus on.


\subsection{Query Preprocessing}
A search query, consisting of words, is stemmed and turned into a list of words.
For each word, we generate a topic distribution based on $\beta$ or prediction of the model.
We combine these distributions and use them to bias our cluster-based random walk, when searching/ranking for articles.

%The pipeline of our framework is divided into five phases which are displayed in \autoref{fig:pipeline}.
