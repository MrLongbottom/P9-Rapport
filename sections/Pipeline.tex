\section{Pipeline}

\input{figures/pipeline_figure.tex}
The pipeline of our framework is divided into five phases which are displayed in \autoref{fig:pipeline}.

\subsection{Article dataset}
We have a dataset consisting of articles from the media group Nordjyske. Their primary focus is to maintain a variety of local newspapers within the North Jutland region of Denmark. 
The data ranges from 2017-2019, where a total of $\sim$270.000 articles have been extracted from their database.

\subsection{Preprocessing Phase}
The extracted articles use the format:
\begin{itemize}
	\item id
	\item headline
	\item body
\end{itemize}
When training the LDA model, we concatenate the \emph{headline} and \emph{body} for simplicity.
The preprocessing phase is described in further detail in \ref{subsec:prepro}.
This phase applies different \gls{NLP} methods to simplify the dataset and remove redundant information.
After the preprocessing phase, we are left with $\sim$130.000 articles.

\subsection{LDA}
We apply the \acrfull{lda} to the dataset to generate topic clusters based on the content of the articles. 
We describe the investigation and selection of hyper parameters in \ref{subsec:lda}. 
After the model has been trained, we have a document-topic distribution matrix $\theta$ and a topic-word distribution matrix $\beta$.
$\theta$ will be used as clusters in the next phase.

\subsection{Cluster-based PageRank}
In this phase, we apply cluster-based random walk, described in section \ref{sec:cluster_pagerank}, to the articles and clusters given in the \gls{lda} phase.
The algorithm yields a prioritized list of articles based on the query provided.


\subsection{Query Preprocessing}
The query given to the search algorithm is stemmed and turned into a list of words. 
This list of words are then queried against LDA to check which cluster each word belongs to.
Lastly it is transformed into a personalization vector to use within the cluster-based PageRank.
