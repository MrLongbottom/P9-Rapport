These questions also emphasize the contributions this paper brings.
We implement a method for constructing an adjacency matrix in order to run \gls{pr}, with no previous information given about connections between the nodes.
This is done by calculating the topic similarity between each document, using Jensen-Shannon distance, and using these similarities as the elements in the matrix.
We also suggest ways to measure the performance of an \gls{ir} method which has to find both specific documents and documents that share a specific topic.
Our system can be used to improve query results for search engines, by introducing a more abstract view of topics within a search query.
