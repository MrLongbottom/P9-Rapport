These questions also emphasize the contributions this paper brings.
We implement a method for creating an adjacency matrix for running \gls{pr}, with no previous connections given between the nodes.
This is done by calculating the topic similarity between each document, using Jensen-Shannon distance, and using these as the elements in the matrix.
We also suggest ways to calculate the performance an information retrieval model has at both finding specific documents and documents that have a general topic.
