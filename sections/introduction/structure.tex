The paper is organized as follows:
In \autoref{sec:related-works}, we reference previous articles related to topic modeling, \gls{ir}, and random walk.
\autoref{sec:dataset} describes the dataset used in the experiments.
\autoref{sec:method} explains the steps of our method, while \autoref{sec:prepro}, \autoref{sec:lm}, \autoref{sec:lda}, \autoref{sec:query}, and \autoref{sec:pagerank} describe these steps in further detail.
In \autoref{sec:experiment} we setup an experiment to test the performance of different combinations of \gls{ir} methods and present the results.
In \autoref{sec:discussion}, we analyze and discuss the results of our experiment.
Finally, in \autoref{sec:conclusion} and \autoref{sec:future_work}, conclusions and future work are given.
