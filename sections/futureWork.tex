\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future_work}

The method, we have presented, can be expanded in different ways. 
An interesting approach, could be to investigate other versions of \gls{lda}, such as the Dynamic Topic Model\cite{blei2006dynamic}, which is good at finding specific topics over time, which might improve the retrieval of old and important articles within a large dataset.

Another approach to our method is to replace standard \gls{pr} with a more sophisticated one, like the Topical PageRank\cite{yang2009topic}. 
Eg. the transistion probability within the adjacency matrix can be changed to focus on the correlation between topics.
