We investigate whether using a topic model can improve \gls{ir} methods.
We employ a probabilistic topic model, specifically \gls{lda}, to automatically extract topics from Danish news articles.
%How can \gls{pr} be used on a dataset without explicit edges?
We use the topic distribution, from the \gls{lda}, to construct the adjacency matrix edge by measuring the Jensen-Shannon distance between each article topic distribution, since references between news articles do not exist.
We use \gls{lda}, \gls{tf-idf}, \gls{bm25}, \gls{lm} and \gls{pr} as our baselines for testing \gls{ir} performance.
We also combine these in various ways to investigate the individual performance of each method.
We evaluate the \gls{ir} methods by generating document and topic queries which are based on the topic distribution from the \gls{lda}.
\gls{bm25} is the best performing baseline, we have, and we improve \gls{bm25} by combining it with \gls{pr}.
