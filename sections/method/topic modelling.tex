\subsection{Topic Modelling}\label{subsec:topicModelling}
The objective of topic modelling is to infer topics (collections of words) in a document set.
The result consists of a topic-word distribution matrix $\varphi$, which for each topic gives a distribution of words belonging to said topic, and a document-topic distribution matrix $\theta$ which for each document gives a distribution of topics which the document belongs to.
