\section{Query Handling}
To search for a given document in a whole data set of document can be a challenge. 
In this setting, we propose to use the topic distributions of each document for searching.
The search process consists of multiple steps before, we are able to use the query within the PageRank algorithm. 
We start with a search query, consisting of words, which are stemmed.
For each word in the query, we check whether our model knows the word.
If it is known, we use the $\beta$ distribution given by the model for the given word. 
If it is not known, we let the model predict the topic distribution for the given word.
We take the average of these distributions and use them to bias our cluster-based random walk, when searching/ranking for articles.
